# Installation
!> Selfhosting is only recommended for people who know what they are doing. If you are not one of these people please use the [public version](https://dsc.gg/shell)

To get started with selfhosting you first must run this command to get Seashell's files on your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeasideDevs/Link-Shortener-Bot
```
This command will clone the file to the machine it is run on so you can start selfhosting!
